# Getting Started

## Welcome to High Societea!

This guide will help you get started with your first game.

### What You Need

- A character sheet (provided in this app)
- Some dice (or use the built-in dice roller)
- Your imagination and a sense of social grace

### Basic Concepts

#### Ability Scores

Your character has six core abilities:
- **Strength (STR)** - Physical power
- **Dexterity (DEX)** - Agility and reflexes
- **Constitution (CON)** - Endurance and health
- **Intelligence (INT)** - Reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom (WIS)** - Awareness and insight
- **Charisma (CHA)** - Force of personality

#### Skills

Skills represent specific abilities your character has learned. Each skill is associated with one of the six ability scores.

#### Rolling Dice

When you attempt an action, you'll roll a d20 (20-sided die) and add your relevant skill modifier. Higher rolls mean better success!

### Your First Session

1. Create your character using the character sheet
2. Work with your group to establish the tea party scenario
3. Role-play your character's actions
4. Roll dice when the outcome is uncertain
5. Have fun!

# Gameplay Rules

## Core Mechanics

### Skill Checks

When you attempt something with an uncertain outcome, the GM may ask you to make a skill check.

**How to Roll:**
1. Roll a d20
2. Add your ability modifier
3. Add your skill proficiency (if applicable)
4. Compare to the Difficulty Class (DC)

### Difficulty Classes

- **Easy** - DC 5
- **Medium** - DC 10
- **Hard** - DC 15
- **Very Hard** - DC 20
- **Nearly Impossible** - DC 25+

### Advantage and Disadvantage

**Advantage:** Roll two d20s and use the higher result
**Disadvantage:** Roll two d20s and use the lower result

## Social Interactions

### The Tea Party

Tea parties are the heart of High Societea. During a tea party:
- Players take turns engaging in conversation
- Hidden agendas and secrets create tension
- Etiquette matters - faux pas have consequences

### Conversation Turns

Each round of conversation consists of:
1. **Greeting/Opening** - Set the tone
2. **Exchange** - Share information or make requests
3. **Response** - React to others' statements
4. **Consequences** - Reputation changes based on success

## Combat (Social Combat)

While physical combat is rare, social combat is common:

### Social Hit Points

Characters have social HP representing their reputation and composure. When reduced to 0, they must leave the party in embarrassment.

### Social Attacks

- **Cutting Remark** - Direct insult (Charisma vs. Wisdom)
- **Subtle Shade** - Indirect insult (Deception vs. Insight)
- **Gossip** - Damage reputation (Persuasion vs. Charisma)
- **Cold Shoulder** - Exclude from conversation (Intimidation vs. Will)
